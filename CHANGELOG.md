## [1.7.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- New CV content schema fields — `salary`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `employment`, `work_format` — with corresponding translation keys (`salary`, `employment`, `work_format`, `education`, `languages`, `about_me`, `location`, `work_permit`) and hh.ru-style layout in `HomePage.astro` (salary block, meta info row, gender/birthdate under name, separate education and languages sections, experience stack tags). Replaces old devops/gamedev profile variants with a single default profile
- Personal info, salary details, and formatted contact values now exported to PDF and DOCX resumes (via `.github/scripts/generate-resume.js` and `src/scripts/resume-export-pdf.mjs`)

### Changed
- Replaced `favicon.svg` (hand-coded vector path) and single-frame `favicon.ico` (32×32) with the black version of the project logo, traced from a high-res PNG. `favicon.svg` preserves the dark-mode-aware fill (`#000` on light, `#FFF` on dark); `favicon.ico` is now a proper multi-resolution ICO (16×16, 32×32, 48×48, 64×64)
- Moved avatar into the hero section and fixed mobile section ordering in `HomePage.astro` (plus `global.css` adjustments)
- Tightened PDF resume spacing so the resume fits on one A4 page — sidebar width 66→63mm, avatar 36→30mm, name 18→16pt, base font 9.5→9pt, reduced line-height and inter-block margins, tighter typography scale across contact/education/skills/languages

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate language skills group appearing in the human-readable PDF export
- `tel:` links in contact entries now validated in the content schema (`linkSchema`) and handled correctly in `HomePage.astro` (no `noopener`/`_blank` for tel: hrefs, same as `mailto:`)
- Fixed period type handling across resume generation scripts — `undefined` values no longer leak into output as literal "undefined" strings (`.github/scripts/generate-resume.js` and `src/scripts/resume-export-pdf.mjs`)

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- `src/content/site/site.yml` — new deployment-wide settings collection, decoupled from any profile or language. First field: `downloads`, controlling which resume-download buttons show on CV pages and in what order (defaults to the flat `[pdf, docx]`). PDF and ATS-PDF/DOCX/TXT split into different audiences — PDF is what a visitor recognizes, ATS-PDF and TXT are mainly useful to the CV's own owner (job-portal upload forms, paste-into-a-textarea), not someone browsing the site — so they no longer clutter the default button row. A demo/marketing deployment can opt into a **grouped** form instead (`downloads: [{group: people, items: [pdf, docx]}, {group: ats, items: [pdfAts, txt]}]`) to show all four with a small labeled heading per audience — required as soon as two entries would render the same one-word button label (pdf and pdfAts both say "PDF"; the qualifier lives on the group heading, e.g. "For ATS", never on the button itself — see `docs/INFO.md` §17 for the convention this is meant to prevent regressing). Group headings reuse the `.skillsgroup__title` idiom already used for CV skills, and translate via `translations.yaml` (`cv.downloads_{group}`). `HomePage.astro` now reads this collection itself (same pattern `Layout.astro` already uses for `languages`/`profiles`/`i18n`) instead of the URLs being threaded through as four separate props from `index.astro`/`[...slug].astro`
- Download buttons now have a visible hierarchy — PDF renders as the one solid/accent button, every other enabled format is a secondary ghost button, instead of four equal-weight buttons with no obvious primary action. Where two buttons intentionally share a visible label (pdf/pdfAts both say "PDF"), each gets a distinct `aria-label` ("Resume PDF" / "ATS-optimized PDF") so a screen reader doesn't announce two identical items
- Opt-out "Made with CV Hub" footer credit (`site.yml`'s new `footerCredit`, on by default) next to the existing GitHub link. Always points at the upstream project regardless of `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` — unlike the rest of the footer, which correctly points at whichever fork is running — so every deployed site stays a discoverable backlink to the project, which is how a template like this one actually grows. Suppressed automatically when the two would be identical (i.e. on the upstream repo's own deployment), where it would otherwise be two links with different labels and the same href
- `/changelog` now links out to the full `CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Releases (URLs derived from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, same self-configuring pattern as the footer) — the on-site version is a curated distillate (see below), and a curated page with no way to reach the full log read as "the project barely changes," the opposite of the intended signal
- `@media print` — printing (or saving to PDF via the browser) now produces a clean document instead of a dark-theme screenshot: nav/footer/animated background/download buttons hidden, root color tokens remapped to print-safe values (reuses the same token-remap trick the theme system already relies on, so every component gets it for free)
- JSON-LD `schema.org/Person` markup on CV/profile pages — name, job title, summary, email and `sameAs` links (GitHub/LinkedIn/Habr/etc. from `contacts`), `knowsAbout` from skills. Built from data the page already parses, no new schema
- `hreflang` alternate tags, reusing the same data that drives the language switcher — CV pages, showcase list and case studies (each scoped to the languages that actually have content); skipped on `noindex`'d pages and on the changelog, which doesn't have a real per-language build
- `noindex` on the 404 page
- Custom domain support — `SITE_URL` / `BASE_PATH` env overrides in `astro.config.mjs`, layered on top of the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`-derived defaults (`{owner}.github.io` / `/{repo}`). Combined with a `public/CNAME` file, a fork can serve from its own domain instead of the default project-page URL
- `npm run init` — one-time onboarding script for a fresh fork. Backs up and clears the repo's own CV, showcase and case-study data (multi-profile reset to a single default) and reseeds it from `docs/examples/*`, so a new user edits a blank placeholder instead of someone else's resume. Interactive prompts for name/title/language, `--dry-run` to preview, `--force` to re-run, no new dependencies (`node:readline/promises`)
- ATS-safe PDF resume — `resume:pdf` now renders a second, single-column PDF (`resume_{lang}[_{spec}]_ats.pdf`) alongside the existing two-column one, from the same CV data. The flagship two-column layout risks scrambled text on ATS parsers that read multi-column pages left-to-right across both columns; the new variant is plain Arial/Helvetica, standard section headings, contacts in the body flow, no icons — reading order in the file matches visual order top to bottom. Linked as a fourth "ATS PDF" download button next to PDF/DOCX/TXT
- Automated OG-image pipeline — `src/scripts/generate-og-image.mjs` screenshots one dedicated `/og-preview/{lang}` route per configured language through Playwright and composites each into a framed, wallpapered 1200×630 card, matching the active theme's own design tokens. Each screenshot renders the real default-profile CV (`public/cv/{lang}.yaml` — same data the site itself shows), not mock data — every page picks the matching-language image automatically via `Layout.astro`, so a `/devops`, `/gamedev` or case-study page reuses the same-language default-profile card instead of a dedicated screenshot per page. Supports `--theme=<name>` (falls back to the default look if unknown) and `--wallpaper=gradient|<image path>`. Runs as the last stage of `npm run build` and in CI (`deploy.yml`, `ci.yml`); images are regenerated every build and never committed to git
- Case-study video block now embeds YouTube — a `src` pointing at `youtube.com/watch`, `youtu.be` or `youtube.com/embed` renders a responsive 16:9 iframe instead of a local `<video>` tag, so a gameplay trailer or clip can be linked directly without hosting an mp4
- New `code` content block (`type: code`) — a verbatim monospace block for terminal commands and short snippets, no syntax-highlighting engine by design
- Any content block (`text`, `image`, `video`, `code`) now accepts `anchor: "id"` for deep-linking into a specific section, e.g. `/showcase/{slug}#quickstart` — accounts for the sticky header so the target isn't hidden underneath it
- Backtick-quoted spans in block prose (`title`, `subtitle`, `body`, `bullets`, `caption`) now render as styled inline code instead of literal backtick characters, via a shared `InlineText` component — fixes existing case studies that already used backticks to mention file names and identifiers
- `/quickstart` and `/get-started` — two short, memorable redirects to the CV Hub quickstart section, meant to replace a bare GitHub repo link in release announcements
- Showcase card featured media now supports an autoplaying, looping `type: video` cover — a lighter drop-in replacement for a heavy animated GIF (silent, muted, no controls)

### Changed
- The on-site `/changelog` (`src/content/changelog/changelog.yaml`) is now a curated distillate of this file, not a line-for-line copy — this file stays the full technical record. The site doubles as a landing page for CV Hub as a product, so a long wall of CI plumbing and internal refactors was net-negative signal there; see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Changelog discipline" for the selection filter
- Upgraded to **Astro 7** (from 5) — brings Vite 8 and closes every outstanding npm advisory; `npm audit` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**, down from 15
- Content collections migrated to the Astro **Content Layer** — `src/content/config.ts` replaced by `src/content.config.ts`, with each collection switched from the removed `type: 'data'` to an explicit `glob()` loader. Rendered output is byte-identical: all 20 pages verified against the Astro 5 build with no content differences
- **Node 24 is now required** to build locally, matching `.nvmrc`, `package.json` `engines` and the CI runner — Astro 7 dropped support for Node 20

### Fixed
- `og:image`/`twitter:image` pointed at the wrong URL on every page — the meta tag never included `base`, so on the deployed project-page site it resolved to `{owner}.github.io/media/og-image.png` instead of `{owner}.github.io/cv_hub/media/og-image.png` and 404'd. Link/social previews have been showing no image because of this
- Canonical, OG and Twitter meta URLs had a literal double slash on every page (`https://…github.io//cv_hub/…`) — `siteUrl` already carried a trailing slash and every consumer added its own leading one. `Layout.astro` now derives `siteUrl` from Astro's own `Astro.site` (which `SITE_URL`/`BASE_PATH` also flow through) instead of hand-rolling it from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
- Footer credit (`GitHub` link, "Alexander Gusarov" byline URL) was hardcoded to the original repo — now derived from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, same as `siteUrl` already was, so a fork's footer points at itself
- CI: Telegram deploy notification no longer misreports a cancelled run as a failed build — `deploy.yml` now skips the notification entirely when `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` supersedes a run, instead of sending a false "Build failed!"
- 404 page rendered a doubled `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` document — it wrapped its own scaffold around `<Layout>`, which already renders a full document — so the page was missing the site header/nav/footer and carried two competing `<title>` tags. Now renders through `<Layout>` like every other page
- i18n: the `notfound404` translation block existed in `translations.yaml` but was missing from the content schema, so it was silently stripped on load — the 404 page's title now actually resolves instead of falling through
- Favicon — `favicon.ico`/`favicon.svg` were committed but never linked from `<head>`, and the browser's passive fallback missed them entirely under the GitHub Pages base path (`/cv_hub/`) — added explicit `<link rel="icon">`, base-path aware
- Case-study hero image (the first `image` block on a Deep Dive page, usually the cover shot under the title) now loads eagerly with `fetchpriority="high"` instead of lazy — same LCP treatment the showcase grid's first card already had
- Case-study images now reserve a 16:9 aspect ratio before loading instead of collapsing to zero height, preventing layout shift as they load in
- Every page previously shared one generic meta description and OG image regardless of content — case studies now use their own `tagline`, CV pages their `summary`, changelog its own subtitle
- Case-study and changelog `<title>` now carry the "— CV Hub" suffix, matching how CV/profile pages already read in a browser tab or search result
- `resume-import-json.mjs` and `resume-import-linkedin.mjs` printed a usage message pointing at npm scripts that don't exist (`npm run convert`, `npm run parse`) — now reference the real `resume:import`/`resume:linkedin` commands
- `resume-import-linkedin.mjs` wrote its JSON output to `docs/` instead of `public/downloads/json/`, contradicting its own doc comment and the sibling import script's convention, and risking collision with the example input files `README.md` documents at that same `docs/` path

### Removed
- `public/themes/*.css` untracked from git — it's a mechanical copy of `src/styles/themes/*.css` regenerated on every dev/build (`astro.config.mjs`'s `copy-themes` plugin), not a source file; committing it separately from its source risked the two drifting out of sync
- ~5.1 MB of orphaned media — stale cover-image variants no longer referenced by any showcase or case-study YAML, plus a duplicate `diceroll/` media folder left over from a prior rename (only `apple-watch-diceroll` is a real slug)

---

## [1.5.5] — 2026-08-26

### Added
- Case-study video block — `type: video` content block, either a silent autoplay loop (short clips) or poster + controls (longer clips)
- CI workflow (`ci.yml`) — pull requests now run the full generation pipeline (merge → DOCX/TXT → PDF → Astro build) and upload the generated resumes and site as downloadable artifacts, so a broken build or malformed YAML is caught before it reaches `main`
- Release workflow (`release.yml`) — publishing a GitHub Release regenerates the resume documents and attaches all PDF/DOCX/TXT files to it, making every version a self-contained CV snapshot
- Dependabot — weekly grouped npm updates and monthly GitHub Actions updates; every update PR is verified by the CI pipeline instead of being merged blind
- Node version pinned via `.nvmrc` and `package.json` `engines` (>=24), matching the CI runner

### Changed
- CI: GitHub Actions runner upgraded to Node 24
- `package.json` version synced to the changelog version (was stuck at `0.0.1` while the project shipped 1.5.x)
- CI: the deploy build step split into named per-stage steps (merge / DOCX+TXT / PDF / Astro) — same runner and cost, but the Actions UI now shows per-stage timing and points at the exact stage that failed
- CI: PDF export now drives the runner's preinstalled Google Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`) instead of downloading Playwright's chromium — removes the `cdn.playwright.dev` download that was stalling and hanging deploys; the Playwright browser-cache step was dropped. Local builds still use Playwright's bundled chromium
- Responsive breakpoints consolidated from seven ad-hoc values to two — `768px` (desktop/mobile base: header, fonts, paddings, animated background) and `960px` (multi-column CV and showcase grids); mobile container side padding tightened

### Fixed
- PDF export now HTML-escapes all interpolated CV data (company names, bullets, contacts, skills) — a stray `<` or `&` in a field no longer breaks or injects into the generated PDF
- Mobile header — the Role dropdown button rendered larger than the nav links (16px vs 14px, wider padding) because a later `.dropdown__trigger { font: inherit }` overrode the mobile rule; the mobile rule's specificity was raised so the button now matches the links

### Removed
- Two unused dependencies — `hast-util-parse-selector` and `serve` were not imported or referenced by any script

---
## [1.5.4] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- Click-to-zoom lightbox for case-study images — clicking any Deep Dive image opens it fullscreen; close via backdrop click, close button or Escape
- SEO: `sitemap.xml` (via `@astrojs/sitemap`, covers all profile × language routes) and `robots.txt` pointing to it
- `merge.mjs` validates the profile `slug === spec` invariant and fails fast with a clear message, preventing silent desync between a profile's URL and its CV/download files

### Changed
- Tags de-emphasized — removed borders and muted text on Platforms/Stack/Tags pills so the identical-looking groups stop competing for attention and section hierarchy reads clearer (lead designer feedback)
- CI: Telegram notification now passes secrets and context through an `env` block instead of inline `${{ }}` interpolation in the shell script

### Fixed
- Removed hover-lift from passive cards (Experience and others) — the global `.card:hover` translate/shadow was a false affordance on non-clickable cards; hover now stays only on interactive showcase project cards (lead designer feedback)
- AnimatedBackground performance — reduced orb blur (80px → 60px), slowed drift cycles to 16–22s and removed `scale()` from keyframes so the blurred layer is cached instead of re-rasterized every frame; cuts desktop scroll/idle jank
- Showcase LCP — first card with an actual image cover now loads `eager` with `fetchpriority="high"`; remaining covers stay lazy
- Role dropdown accessibility — added `aria-haspopup`, `aria-controls` and `aria-expanded` synced with open state; removed a stray always-true `active` class on the trigger
- i18n: showcase card labels (Platforms/Stack/Tags/Featured) on non-default-language lists no longer fall back to English literals — a stray `[lang]` index on an already-resolved string was dropping the real translations; now correctly localized and ready for additional languages
- Build robustness: home page now guards a missing merged CV artifact with a fallback instead of crashing the build (matches the dynamic profile route)

### Removed
- Dead code in the dynamic showcase route — unused featured/regular/archived split, leftover CSS classes and a stray `...` token in the card markup

---
## [1.5.3] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- `PlayStationWaves.astro` — XMB-inspired filled sine-wave canvas background; configurable via props (wave count, speed, amplitude, color, opacity, background gradient, draw quality); time-of-day hue shift; non-deterministic start via `Date.now()` offset
- `WaveLines.astro` — XMB-style glowing stroke wave lines canvas background; symmetric line arrangement around center Y; per-line glow via offscreen canvas compositing; same prop/config system
- GitHub Actions Telegram notification — `deploy.yml` notifies a Telegram bot on deploy success/failure via `PIPLINE_BOT_SECRET` and `CHAT_ID` secrets; gracefully skips if secrets are not configured
- CI: Playwright Chromium cached by `package-lock.json` hash — saves ~2 min per deploy on cache hit
- `LICENSE` — MIT license added to repository
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — root-level architecture overview: stack, data pipeline, routing, theming, background components, CI/CD, key trade-offs
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; root-level changelog in Keep a Changelog format covering full version history from 1.0.0

### Fixed
- `WaveLines` glow compositing bug — original `destination-in` mask was applied to the full canvas each iteration, progressively destroying background alpha at edges; fixed by isolating each line's glow on a dedicated offscreen canvas
- Telegram notification now covers build failures — `notify_telegram` uses `needs: [build, deploy]` with `if: always()` so a failed build also triggers notification; message extended with branch name and short commit SHA
- Sticky header now works unconditionally — `html, body { height: 100% }` constrained body to viewport height, causing scroll to happen on `<html>` and making `position: sticky` ineffective; changed to `html { height: 100% }` / `body { min-height: 100% }`
- Role dropdown — replaced CSS `:hover` toggle with JS click-toggle and click-outside to close; menu no longer closes on accidental cursor exit; added smooth opacity/transform transition
- Scroll jank — body `background-attachment: fixed` replaced with a fixed pseudo-element layer; gradients no longer repaint on every scroll frame
- Removed `mix-blend-mode: overlay` from the scanline noise layer — eliminated a fullscreen compositing pass per frame with no visible difference at 0.06 opacity

---

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Language switcher on Showcase list now correctly switches language instead of redirecting to home
- Language switcher on Case Study pages now correctly switches language of the current project
- Back button and Showcase nav link now preserve current language across navigation
- Project card links now respect BASE_URL — no more hardcoded `/cv_hub/` prefix required in YAML
- ProjectPage mobile layout — horizontal padding now correctly applied on small screens
- Showcase slug setup for other languages was incorrect for projects with `archived` and `featured` flags

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-31

- `[...slug].astro` — dynamic routing for all profile × language combos
- Per-profile PDF/DOCX/TXT generation for all profiles and languages

### Changed

- Download links now point to profile-specific files (`resume_en_devops.pdf`)

### Removed

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-11
